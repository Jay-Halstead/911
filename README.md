# 911
911 is one of my newer scripts and was put out pretty quick so if there are bugs, please let me know. It is a 911 system where you can do /911 [report] in-game and you can call for LEOs or whoever to your location. It also uses a webhook where you can setup in your server.lua and it sends the 911 call to your discord server. Also, when you do /911 [report], it shows up with a circle around the general area for a more realistic look and feel!
